## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook explores the fundamental components of the Data Science ecosystem. It highlights programming languages, libraries, and development tools frequently employed by Data Scientists.

## Data Science Languages

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
1. Python
2. R
3. Julia

## Data Science Libraries

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

## Data Science Tools

Here are three open-source tools used in data science:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda
- Visual Studio Code with Python extension

## Arithmetic Expressions Examples

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
In a code cell, you can perform operations like multiplying and adding integers:
```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply and then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)  # Output: 17
